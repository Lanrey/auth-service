## Documentation
> Scribe is a fork of [mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator](https://github.com/mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator), so see the [migration guide](https://scribe.rtfd.io/en/latest/migrating.html) if you're coming from there.

Check out the documentation at [ReadTheDocs](http://scribe.rtfd.io/).

## Installation
PHP 7.2.5 and Laravel/Lumen 5.8 or higher are required.

```sh
composer require --dev knuckleswtf/scribe
```

### Laravel
Publish the config file by running:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Knuckles\Scribe\ScribeServiceProvider" --tag=scribe-config
```

This will create a `scribe.php` file in your `config` folder.

### Lumen
- When using Lumen, you will need to run `composer require knuckleswtf/scribe` instead (no `--dev`.
- Register the service provider in your `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
$app->register(\Knuckles\Scribe\ScribeServiceProvider::class);
```

- Copy the config file from `vendor/knuckleswtf/scribe/config/scribe.php` to your project as `config/scribe.php`. Then add to your `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
$app->configure('scribe');
```
